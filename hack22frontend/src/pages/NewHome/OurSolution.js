          By importing google map data to support our application, we made it simpler for users to enter their starting point and destination, and our algorithm is able to generate the optimal solution for our users.
Our algorithm to sorts routes based on time, cost, and users' personal choice, especailly for those who are handicapped, we realize that several travelling options may not apply to them, so our algorithm is designed to be able to fullfill their needs.
In our sorting algorithm, we build a linked list to store each separate route, and use an array to store all routes.
When user enter their start position, goal location, and their travelling habits, our website will list all the routes based on the priority.
