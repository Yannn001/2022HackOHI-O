Current Problem
The main problems are
    1. Waiting OSU cabs wastes too much time
    2. There are few selections for people to travel on campus
    3. For some medium distance travel, there is not a perfect choice for people.
We would like to design a website in order to help people move more convenient. When people enter their information, we will pick up several "best" routes for them.
